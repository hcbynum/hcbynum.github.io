<p> Good Day All! First and foremost I would like to start by stating thank you for visiting my site. A little bit about me, I am a military spouse. I fortunately enjoy traveling quite frequently with my spouse when I am able to. I often enjoy baking home recipes from scratch and showing others how to create simple, healthy and delicious foods at home. When I was young my grandmother helped raise me to can our vegetables, fruits and the jams we made together. I strive to continue her legacy by teaching all those who are willing to listen about the joys of making your own foods and vegetables at home. One goal I have for this life time is to grow a farm and live off of the produce I grow through canning and creating sustainable meals for my family. Please enjoy some of the recipes I have to offer as well leave me a few of your own that I can show to friends and family alike. Thank you again and enjoy!  Please head over to the contact me page to find resources to connect with me personally. Enjoy! </p>
